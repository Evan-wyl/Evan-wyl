- 👋 Hi, I’m @Evan-wyl
- 👀 I’m interested in Robot Learning and Multimodal Large-Model.
- 🌱 I'm currently focusing on language conditioned policy and vision-lanuage-action model of Robot.
- 🍁 I'm paying attention to:
  - Sample Efficiency of RL,
  - Sparse Reward Problem of RL,
  - Distributional Training of RL,
  - Multi-Task of Robot Learning,
  - Long-Horizon Reasoning,
  - Foundation Model,
  - and Sim-to-Real.
